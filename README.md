# HangmanGame
Quick hangman game to be created over 3-5 days with basic GUI.

This project will be used as an introduction to using PyQt5 and will also allow me to
work on my python fundamentals.

The game will supply a text file which will be used to randomly select a word and the user
can guess letters and be shown the current progress towards completing the word after each
guess. The game will use the classic view of a 'hangman' and will also display the 
current number of lives the player has remaining.
